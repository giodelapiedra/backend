# Work Readiness Assessment Submission Fix

## Problem
The work readiness assessment submission was failing with a 400 Bad Request error. The issue was a mismatch between the frontend and backend data format expectations.

## Root Cause
The backend API endpoint `/api/goal-kpi/submit-assessment` expected:
```javascript
{
  workerId: string,
  assessmentData: {
    readinessLevel: string,  // camelCase
    fatigueLevel: number,    // camelCase
    mood: string,
    painDiscomfort: string,
    notes: string
  }
}
```

But the frontend was sending:
```javascript
{
  workerId: string,
  assessmentData: {
    readiness_level: string,  // snake_case
    fatigue_level: number,    // snake_case
    mood: string,
    pain_discomfort: string,  // snake_case
    notes: string
  }
}
```

## Solution
Updated the frontend to transform the data format before sending to the backend API.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `frontend/src/pages/worker/WorkerDashboard.tsx`
**Two functions were fixed:**

1. **`handleSimpleWorkReadinessSubmit`** (line ~635)
2. **`handleConfirmWorkReadiness`** (line ~875)

**Before:**
```javascript
const cycleResult = await kpiAPI.submitAssessment({ 
  workerId: user.id,
  assessmentData: workReadinessData  // Wrong format
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Prepare assessment data in the format expected by the backend
const assessmentData = {
  readinessLevel: workReadinessData.readiness_level,
  fatigueLevel: workReadinessData.fatigue_level,
  mood: workReadinessData.mood,
  painDiscomfort: workReadinessData.pain_discomfort,
  notes: workReadinessData.notes
};

const cycleResult = await kpiAPI.submitAssessment({ 
  workerId: user.id,
  assessmentData: assessmentData  // Correct format
});
```

## Backend Validation
The backend validates:
- `readinessLevel` must be one of: `'fit'`, `'minor'`, `'not_fit'`
- `fatigueLevel` must be a number between 1 and 10
- Worker must have an active assignment for today
- Worker must not have already submitted today

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. âœ… Simple work readiness form submission works
2. âœ… Regular work readiness form submission works  
3. âœ… Data format matches backend expectations
4. âœ… All validation passes on backend
5. âœ… Cycle tracking and KPI calculations work correctly

## Error Messages
The backend now properly returns specific error messages:
- "Worker ID is required"
- "Assessment data is required" 
- "Valid readiness level is required (fit, minor, not_fit)"
- "Fatigue level must be a number between 1 and 10"
- "No active work readiness assignment found for today"
- "Worker not found"

## Impact
- âœ… Workers can now successfully submit work readiness assessments
- âœ… Team leaders receive notifications when assessments are submitted
- âœ… KPI tracking and cycle calculations work properly
- âœ… Assignment system integration works correctly
- âœ… No more 400 Bad Request errors

The work readiness assessment submission is now fully functional! ðŸŽ¯
