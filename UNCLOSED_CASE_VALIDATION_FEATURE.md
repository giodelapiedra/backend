# Unclosed Unselected Case Validation Feature

## 📋 Overview
Nag-add ng enhanced validation para sa workers na may unclosed unselected cases. Kapag mag-assign ng worker na may unclosed case, lalabas ang clear error message with date indication.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Unclosed Case Detection with Dates** 📅
**What it does**: Bago mag-create ng assignment, iche-check kung may unclosed unselected cases ang mga selected workers.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Check if any selected workers have unclosed unselected cases
const workersWithUnclosedCases = selectedWorkers
  .map(workerId => {
    const unclosedCase = unselectedWorkers.find(unselected => 
      unselected.worker_id === workerId && 
      unselected.case_status !== 'closed'
    );
    
    if (unclosedCase) {
      const worker = teamMembers.find(m => m.id === workerId);
      return {
        workerId,
        workerName: worker ? `${worker.first_name} ${worker.last_name}` : 'Unknown Worker',
        caseDate: unclosedCase.assignment_date,
        reason: unclosedCase.reason
      };
    }
    return null;
  })
  .filter(Boolean);
```

### 2. **Detailed Error Message with Date Information** 📝
**What it shows**: 
- Worker name
- Date ng unclosed case
- Clear instruction kung paano i-resolve

**Message Format**:
```
Some workers have unclosed unselected cases. Please close their cases first before assigning new tasks.

• John Doe - Unclosed case from October 15, 2025
• Jane Smith - Unclosed case from October 18, 2025

You can close these cases from the Unselected Workers section below.
```

**Code**:
```typescript
if (workersWithUnclosedCases.length > 0) {
  const workersList = workersWithUnclosedCases
    .map(w => `• ${w!.workerName} - Unclosed case from ${new Date(w!.caseDate).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
      year: 'numeric',
      month: 'long',
      day: 'numeric'
    })}`)
    .join('\n');
  
  setOverdueBlockingMessage(
    `Some workers have unclosed unselected cases. Please close their cases first before assigning new tasks.\n\n${workersList}\n\nYou can close these cases from the Unselected Workers section below.`
  );
  setShowOverdueBlockingDialog(true);
  return;
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Dialog Display** 🎨
**Improvements**:
- ✅ Better text formatting with `whiteSpace: 'pre-line'`
- ✅ Left-aligned text para mas readable ang list
- ✅ Wider dialog (`maxWidth="sm"`) para kasya ang dates
- ✅ Contextual help message

**Dialog Enhancement**:
```typescript
<DialogContent sx={{ p: 3 }}>
  <Box sx={{ 
    p: 2.5, 
    bgcolor: '#fef2f2', 
    borderRadius: 1.5, 
    border: '1px solid #fecaca',
    mb: 2
  }}>
    <Typography 
      variant="body1" 
      sx={{ 
        fontWeight: 600, 
        color: '#991b1b', 
        lineHeight: 1.8,
        whiteSpace: 'pre-line',  // ✅ Allows line breaks
        textAlign: 'left'        // ✅ Left-align for better readability
      }}
    >
      {overdueBlockingMessage}
    </Typography>
  </Box>

  {/* ✅ Conditional help message */}
  {overdueBlockingMessage.includes('unclosed unselected cases') ? (
    <Alert severity="info" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
      <Typography variant="body2">
        💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Go to the Unselected Workers section below and click "Close Case" for these workers to make them available for assignment again.
      </Typography>
    </Alert>
  ) : (
    // Other messages...
  )}
</DialogContent>
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Single Worker with Unclosed Case
**Steps**:
1. Create unselected case for Worker A (Oct 15, 2025)
2. Try to assign Worker A on Oct 19, 2025
3. **Expected**: Error shows "Worker A - Unclosed case from October 15, 2025"

### Test Case 2: Multiple Workers with Unclosed Cases
**Steps**:
1. Create unselected cases for Worker A (Oct 10) and Worker B (Oct 15)
2. Try to assign both workers
3. **Expected**: Error shows both workers with their respective dates

### Test Case 3: Mixed Selection
**Steps**:
1. Worker A has unclosed case
2. Worker B is available
3. Select both A and B
4. **Expected**: Error shows only Worker A, Worker B should proceed

### Test Case 4: Old vs Recent Cases

## 📝 Technical Details

### Validation Timing:
- **When**: After shift check, before overdue check
- **Where**: `handleCreateAssignments()` function (lines 844-879)
- **Priority**: Runs early to catch issues before other validations

### Data Structure:
```typescript
interface WorkerWithUnclosedCase {
  workerId: string;
  workerName: string;
  caseDate: string;  // ISO date format
  reason: string;    // Reason for unselected status
}
```

### Date Formatting:
- Uses `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })`
- Example output: "October 15, 2025"
- Human-readable format for better UX

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### 1. With `isWorkerUnavailable` function:
- Workers with unclosed cases already marked as unavailable
- This validation provides additional user feedback

### 2. With Unselected Workers section:
- Error message directs users to close cases
- Seamless workflow from error to resolution

### 3. With Dialog System:
- Reuses existing `showOverdueBlockingDialog`
- Consistent UI/UX across all blocking scenarios
