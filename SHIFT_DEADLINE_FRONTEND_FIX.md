# Shift-Based Deadline Frontend Fix

## Issue Identified
The confirmation dialog was still showing "End of Day (11:59 PM)" instead of the shift-based deadline information, even though the backend was correctly calculating shift-based deadlines.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **Confirmation Dialog Updates**
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/WorkReadinessAssignmentManager.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated "Due Time" display from "End of Day (11:59 PM)" to "Based on your shift schedule (will be calculated automatically)"
  - Added explanation in the info alert about automatic deadline calculation
  - Updated print function to show "Based on shift schedule" instead of hardcoded time

### 2. **Success Message Enhancement**
- **Already Working**: The success message was already set up to display the actual calculated deadline from the backend response
- **Shows**: Real deadline information like "Deadline set to end of Midnight Shift shift (08:00:00)"

## 🎯 **Now When Creating Assignments:**

### **Confirmation Dialog Shows:**
```
Assignment Details:
- Date: 10/9/2025
- Due Time: Based on your shift schedule (will be calculated automatically)
- Selected Workers: 27 worker(s)
- Unselected Workers: 0 worker(s) with reasons

ℹ️ This action will create assignments for selected workers and record reasons for unselected workers. 
The deadline will be automatically calculated based on your current shift schedule. This cannot be undone.
```

### **Success Message Shows:**
```
Successfully created assignments for 27 worker(s)

Deadline set to end of Midnight Shift shift (08:00:00)
```

## 🚀 **Complete Flow:**

1. **Team Leader** creates assignment
2. **Confirmation Dialog** shows shift-based deadline info
3. **Backend** calculates deadline based on team leader's shift
4. **Success Message** shows actual calculated deadline
5. **Assignment Table** displays the correct deadline

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- ❌ "End of Day (11:59 PM)" → ✅ "Based on shift schedule"
- ❌ Hardcoded deadline → ✅ Dynamic shift-based deadline
- ❌ Confusing confirmation → ✅ Clear shift-based explanation

**The shift-based deadline system is now fully working end-to-end!** 🎉
