# KPI Calculation Fixes - Complete Summary

## 📋 Overview
Na-fix na lahat ng critical KPI calculation issues sa Work Readiness Assignment Manager. Ang KPI ngayon ay accurate, fair, at consistent.

---

## ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **FIXED: "On Time" Calculation** ⏰

#### **Before (MALI)**:
```typescript
// Used 24 hours from assigned_date
const assignedDate = new Date(assignment.assigned_date);
const completedDate = new Date(assignment.completed_at || assignment.assigned_date);
const isOnTime = completedDate <= new Date(assignedDate.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

// Example:
// Assigned: Oct 19, 6:00 AM
// Due: Oct 19, 2:00 PM (8 hours deadline)
// Completed: Oct 19, 11:00 PM (17 hours late!)
// Result: ✅ Counted as "On Time" ❌ MALI!
```

**Problem**: Ignores the actual `due_time`, workers get credit for late submissions

#### **After (TAMA)** :
```typescript
// FIXED: Use actual due_time
if (assignment.due_time && assignment.completed_at) {
  const dueDate = new Date(assignment.due_time);
  const completedDate = new Date(assignment.completed_at);
  const isOnTime = completedDate <= dueDate;
  
  if (isOnTime) {
    workerData.onTime++;
  }
}

// Example:
// Assigned: Oct 19, 6:00 AM
// Due: Oct 19, 2:00 PM
// Completed: Oct 19, 11:00 PM
// Result: ❌ NOT On Time ✅ TAMA!
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Accurate tracking of on-time vs late submissions
- ✅ Workers can't game the system
- ✅ Fair performance measurement

---

### 2. **FIXED: Readiness Score Normalization** 📊

#### **Before (MALI)**:
```typescript
const readinessScore = worker.avgReadiness || 0; // Could be 1-10 or 0-100

// If avgReadiness is on 1-10 scale:
const completionRate = 90;  // 0-100 scale
const onTimeRate = 80;      // 0-100 scale
const readinessScore = 8;   // 1-10 scale ❌
const overallScore = (90 + 80 + 8) / 3 = 59.33 // UNFAIR!
```

**Problem**: Mixing different scales causes unfair scoring

#### **After (TAMA)**:
```typescript
// FIXED: Normalize readiness to 0-100 scale
if (assignment.work_readiness?.readiness_level) {
  let readinessLevel = parseFloat(assignment.work_readiness.readiness_level);
  
  // If on 1-10 scale, convert to 0-100
  if (readinessLevel <= 10) {
    readinessLevel = readinessLevel * 10;
  }
  
  workerData.avgReadiness = 
    (workerData.avgReadiness * (workerData.completed - 1) + readinessLevel) 
    / workerData.completed;
}

// Now all on same scale:
const completionRate = 90;    // 0-100 scale
const onTimeRate = 80;        // 0-100 scale
const readinessScore = 80;    // 0-100 scale ✅
const overallScore = (90 + 80 + 80) / 3 = 83.33 // FAIR!
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ All metrics on same 0-100 scale
- ✅ Fair comparison across all components
- ✅ Accurate overall scores

---

### 3. **FIXED: Overdue Penalty** 💥

#### **Before (MALI)**:
```typescript
// Only counted completed assignments
if (assignment.status === 'completed') {
  workerData.completed++;
  // Calculate on-time rate
}

// No penalty for overdue!
// Worker with 5 completed + 3 overdue looked same as worker with 5 completed + 0 overdue
```

**Problem**: Overdue assignments ignored, no consequences for poor performance

#### **After (TAMA)**:
```typescript
// Track overdue assignments
if (assignment.status === 'overdue') {
  workerData.overdue++;
}

// Apply penalty in final score
const overduePenalty = worker.overdue * 5; // -5 points per overdue
overallScore = Math.max(0, overallScore - overduePenalty);

// Example:
// Worker A: 90 base score, 0 overdue = 90 final ✅
// Worker B: 90 base score, 3 overdue = 75 final (90 - 15) ✅
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Overdue assignments penalized (-5 points each)
- ✅ Encourages timely completion
- ✅ Differentiates good vs poor performers

---

### 4. **FIXED: Consistent KPI Across Dates** 📅

#### **Before (MALI)**:
```typescript
// Used filteredAssignments (depends on date filter)
filteredAssignments.forEach(assignment => {
  // Only counts assignments for selected date
});

// Problem:
// Filter Oct 19 → Worker A rank #1
// Filter Oct 18 → Worker A rank #5
// Rankings keep changing! Confusing!
```

**Problem**: KPI changes every time you change date filter

#### **After (TAMA)**:
```typescript
// Use ALL assignments for consistent KPI
assignments.forEach(assignment => {
  // Counts ALL assignments regardless of filter
});

// Result:
// Filter Oct 19 → Worker A rank #3
// Filter Oct 18 → Worker A rank #3
// Filter All → Worker A rank #3
// Consistent across all filters! ✅
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Stable rankings regardless of date filter
- ✅ Consistent performance measurement
- ✅ Less user confusion

---

### 5. **FIXED: On-Time Rate Calculation** 🎯

#### **Before (MALI)**:
```typescript
// On-time rate = onTime / completed
const onTimeRate = (worker.onTime / worker.completed) * 100;

// Example:
// Total: 10 assignments
// Completed on-time: 5
// Completed late: 2
// Overdue: 3
// On-time rate: 5/7 = 71% ❌ Ignores overdue!
```

**Problem**: Doesn't include overdue in denominator, inflates score

#### **After (TAMA)**:
```typescript
// On-time rate = onTime / total assignments
const onTimeRate = (worker.onTime / worker.assignments) * 100;

// Example:
// Total: 10 assignments
// Completed on-time: 5
// Completed late: 2
// Overdue: 3
// On-time rate: 5/10 = 50% ✅ Accurate!
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Fair calculation including all assignments
- ✅ Overdue assignments affect rate
- ✅ More accurate performance picture

---

### 6. **FIXED: Overdue Worker Blocking** 🚫

#### **Before (MALI)**:
```typescript
// Check if overdue but logic was reversed
if (currentShift && assignment.due_time) {
  const dueTime = new Date(assignment.due_time);
  const now = new Date();
  return now < dueTime; // ❌ If overdue, now should be > dueTime!
}
```

**Problem**: Logic contradiction - checking wrong condition

#### **After (TAMA)**:
```typescript
// Check hours since becoming overdue
if (currentShift && assignment.due_time) {
  const dueTime = new Date(assignment.due_time);
  const now = new Date();
  
  // Calculate hours past due
  const hoursPastDue = (now.getTime() - dueTime.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  
  // Block for 8 hours after overdue (next shift cycle)
  return hoursPastDue < 8;
}
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Correct logic for overdue checking
- ✅ Workers blocked for 8 hours after overdue
- ✅ Allows time for shift transition

---

## 📊 **KPI FORMULA COMPARISON**

### Before (MALI):
```
Completion Rate = completed / total assignments
On-Time Rate = onTime / completed (only completed, ignores overdue)
Readiness Score = avgReadiness (unknown scale, could be 1-10 or 0-100)

Overall Score = (Completion Rate + On-Time Rate + Readiness Score) / 3
Final Score = Overall Score (no penalties)
```

### After (TAMA):
```
Completion Rate = completed / total assignments
On-Time Rate = onTime / total assignments (includes overdue)
Readiness Score = avgReadiness (normalized to 0-100 scale)

Base Score = (Completion Rate + On-Time Rate + Readiness Score) / 3
Overdue Penalty = overdue count × 5 points
Final Score = Max(0, Base Score - Overdue Penalty)
```

## 🎯 **EXAMPLE SCENARIOS**

### Scenario 1: Perfect Worker
```
Total Assignments: 10
Completed on-time: 10
Completed late: 0
Overdue: 0
Avg Readiness: 9/10

Calculation:
- Completion Rate: 10/10 × 100 = 100
- On-Time Rate: 10/10 × 100 = 100
- Readiness Score: 9 × 10 = 90
- Base Score: (100 + 100 + 90) / 3 = 96.67
- Overdue Penalty: 0 × 5 = 0
- Final Score: 96.67

Rating: Excellent ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Good Worker with Some Late
```
Total Assignments: 10
Completed on-time: 7
Completed late: 2
Overdue: 1
Avg Readiness: 8/10

Calculation:
- Completion Rate: 9/10 × 100 = 90
- On-Time Rate: 7/10 × 100 = 70
- Readiness Score: 8 × 10 = 80
- Base Score: (90 + 70 + 80) / 3 = 80
- Overdue Penalty: 1 × 5 = 5
- Final Score: 80 - 5 = 75

Rating: Good ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Poor Performer
```
Total Assignments: 10
Completed on-time: 3
Completed late: 2
Overdue: 5
Avg Readiness: 6/10

Calculation:
- Completion Rate: 5/10 × 100 = 50
- On-Time Rate: 3/10 × 100 = 30
- Readiness Score: 6 × 10 = 60
- Base Score: (50 + 30 + 60) / 3 = 46.67
- Overdue Penalty: 5 × 5 = 25
- Final Score: 46.67 - 25 = 21.67

Rating: Needs Improvement ✅
```
