# Test: Create Team Member Button

## ✅ Changes Made

Added console logging to both "Create Team Member" buttons para makita natin kung bakit hindi gumagana.

## 📋 Testing Steps:

### Step 1: Refresh the Page
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/team-leader
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
3. Wait for page to load completely
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
```
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Click on "Console" tab
3. Clear any existing logs (click trash icon)
```

### Step 3: Try Clicking the Button
```
1. Click "Create Your First Team Member" (center button)
2. OR click "+ Create Team Member" (top right button)
3. Watch the console for messages
```

## 🔍 What to Look For:

### If Button Works:
You should see in console:
```
🔘 Create Your First Team Member button clicked!
📋 Current state: { showCreateUser: false }
👤 User: { ... user data ... }
✅ Dialog should open now
```

Then a dialog/modal should appear para mag-create ng user.

###  If Button Doesn't Work:

**Case 1: No console message at all**
- Button might be covered by another element
- Try clicking different parts of the button
- Check if there's a loading overlay

**Case 2: Console shows error (red text)**
- Copy the FULL error message
- Send it to me para ma-fix

**Case 3: Console shows the log but dialog doesn't appear**
- There's an issue with the dialog rendering
- Send me a screenshot

## 🎯 Quick Debug Commands:

Open browser console and type:

```javascript
// Check if user is loaded
console.log('User:', user);

// Check current state
console.log('Show Create User:', showCreateUser);

// Try manually opening the dialog
setShowCreateUser(true);
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue 1: Button looks disabled
**Fix:**
- Logout and login again
- Check if account is active: `node test-new-team-leader.js`

### Issue 2: Nothing happens when clicking
**Fix:**
- Check if backend is running (http://localhost:5000)
- Check if frontend is running (http://localhost:3000)
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Issue 3: Page is blank or loading forever
**Fix:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure user exists in database
- Verify user.id matches between Auth and database

1. **Screenshot** of the page with F12 console open
2. **Copy all console messages** (especially red errors)
3. **Account email** you're testing with
