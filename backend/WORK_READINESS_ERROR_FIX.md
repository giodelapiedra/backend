# Work Readiness Submission Error Fix

## Problem Description
When submitting work readiness data through the SimpleWorkReadiness component, users were getting this error:
```
Error submitting work readiness: Error: Database error: record "new" has no field "progress_percentage"
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by two main issues:

### 1. Missing Database Policies
The `work_readiness` table had Row Level Security (RLS) enabled but was missing INSERT policies. This prevented users from inserting data into the table.

### 2. Constraint Mismatch
The database schema had a constraint `CHECK (fatigue_level BETWEEN 1 AND 5)` but the frontend was sending values in the 0-10 range, causing constraint violations.

### 3. Incomplete TypeScript Types
The TypeScript interface for the work_readiness table was missing several fields that exist in the actual database schema.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fix (`fix-work-readiness-comprehensive.sql`)
- **Removed restrictive constraint**: Changed `fatigue_level` constraint from `BETWEEN 1 AND 5` to `BETWEEN 0 AND 10`
- **Added missing INSERT policy**: `"Workers can insert own work readiness"` 
- **Added UPDATE policy**: `"Team leaders can update work readiness status"`

### 2. Frontend Code Fix (`WorkerDashboard.tsx`)
- **Improved data validation**: Added `Math.max(0, Math.min(10, data.fatigueLevel))` to ensure values stay within 0-10 range
- **Added notes field**: Included `notes: data.notes || null` in the data mapping
- **Better error handling**: Enhanced data mapping with proper null handling

### 3. TypeScript Types Fix (`supabase.ts`)
- **Updated work_readiness interface**: Added missing fields like `pain_areas`, `notes`, `reviewed_by_id`, `reviewed_at`, `follow_up_reason`, `follow_up_notes`
- **Made optional fields properly optional**: Used `?` for fields that can be null/undefined

## Files Modified
1. `fix-work-readiness-comprehensive.sql` - Database schema and policy fixes
2. `frontend/src/pages/worker/WorkerDashboard.tsx` - Frontend data mapping improvements
3. `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` - TypeScript interface updates

## How to Apply the Fix
1. Run the SQL script `fix-work-readiness-comprehensive.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. The frontend changes are already applied to the codebase
3. Test the work readiness submission to ensure it works correctly

## Testing
After applying the fixes, the work readiness submission should work without errors. The system will:
- Accept fatigue levels from 0-10 (matching the frontend sliders)
- Allow workers to insert their own work readiness data
- Allow team leaders to update work readiness status
- Properly handle all optional fields like notes

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always ensure database constraints match frontend data ranges
- Include all necessary RLS policies when enabling RLS on tables
- Keep TypeScript interfaces in sync with database schemas
- Test data insertion after schema changes
