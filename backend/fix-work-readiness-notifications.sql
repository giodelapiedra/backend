-- Fix Work Readiness Notifications Issue
-- This script addresses the team leader assignment and notification problems

-- 1. First, let's check the current state of team assignments
SELECT 
    'Current Team Assignments' as section,
    u.id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.role,
    u.team,
    u.team_leader_id,
    u.managed_teams,
    u.is_active
FROM users u
WHERE u.role IN ('team_leader', 'worker')
ORDER BY u.role, u.team;

-- 2. Check recent work readiness submissions and their team assignments
SELECT 
    'Recent Work Readiness Submissions' as section,
    wr.id,
    wr.worker_id,
    wr.team_leader_id,
    wr.team,
    wr.readiness_level,
    wr.submitted_at,
    u.first_name as worker_name,
    u.last_name as worker_last_name,
    u.team as worker_team
FROM work_readiness wr
LEFT JOIN users u ON wr.worker_id = u.id
ORDER BY wr.submitted_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Check notifications sent to team leaders
SELECT 
    'Notifications to Team Leaders' as section,
    n.id,
    n.recipient_id,
    n.sender_id,
    n.type,

    n.is_read,
    n.created_at,

    tl.last_name as team_leader_last_name,
    sender.first_name as sender_name,
    sender.last_name as sender_last_name
FROM notifications n
LEFT JOIN users tl ON n.recipient_id = tl.id
LEFT JOIN users sender ON n.sender_id = sender.id
WHERE tl.role = 'team_leader'
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 4. Fix team assignments - Update workers to have proper team_leader_id
-- This will ensure workers are properly linked to their team leaders
UPDATE users 
SET team_leader_id = (
    SELECT tl.id 
    FROM users tl 
    WHERE tl.role = 'team_leader' 
    AND tl.is_active = true

    )
    LIMIT 1
)
WHERE role = 'worker' 
AND team_leader_id IS NULL
AND team IS NOT NULL;

-- 5. Verify the fix worked
SELECT 
    'Updated Team Assignments' as section,
