Based on the codebase analysis, here's the proper flow of your Occupational Rehabilitation Management System:
ðŸ”„ Complete System Flow
1. INCIDENT REPORTING PHASE
text
Apply to WorkerDashbo...
Site Supervisor/Employer â†’ Reports Incident â†’ System Creates Case
Who can report:
â€¢	Site Supervisor (http://localhost:3000/site-supervisor)
â€¢	Employer (http://localhost:3000/employer)
What happens:

â€¢	System automatically creates a Case (regardless of severity)
â€¢	Case gets assigned to available Case Manager and Clinician
â€¢	Work restrictions are set based on severity
2. CASE MANAGEMENT PHASE

Case Manager â†’ Reviews Case â†’ Assigns Clinician â†’ Updates Status
Case Status Flow:
1.	new â†’ Case created from incident
2.	triaged â†’ Case Manager reviews and prioritizes
3.	assessed â†’ Clinician performs initial assessment
4.	in_rehab â†’ Rehabilitation plan created
5.	return_to_work â†’ Worker ready to return
6.	closed â†’ Case completed
3. WORKER ENGAGEMENT PHASE
text
Apply to WorkerDashbo...
Worker â†’ Receives Notification â†’ Daily Check-ins â†’ Follows Rehab Plan
Worker Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/worker):
â€¢	Sees notification for new incidents
â€¢	Daily check-ins for pain, functional status, compliance
â€¢	Rehabilitation plans with exercises and goals
â€¢	Appointments with clinicians
4. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT PHASE
text
Apply to WorkerDashbo...
Clinician â†’ Assessment â†’ Rehab Plan â†’ Monitor Progress â†’ Return to Work
Clinician Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/clinician):
â€¢	Triage queue for new cases
â€¢	Create rehabilitation plans with exercises
â€¢	Book appointments (including telehealth)
â€¢	Monitor worker progress through check-ins
5. COMPLIANCE MONITORING PHASE
text
Apply to WorkerDashbo...
Site Supervisor â†’ Monitor Restrictions â†’ Track Compliance â†’ Provide Feedback
Site Supervisor Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/site-supervisor):
â€¢	View worker restrictions from cases
â€¢	Monitor compliance with work restrictions
â€¢	Submit duty feedback on worker performance
â€¢	Report new incidents
6. EMPLOYER OVERSIGHT PHASE
text
Apply to WorkerDashbo...
Employer â†’ Monitor Cases â†’ View Analytics â†’ En
Employer Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/employer):
â€¢	View all worker cases
â€¢	Monitor compliance and restrictions
â€¢	Access analytics dashboard
â€¢	Generate reports
ðŸŽ¯ Key Roles & Responsibilities
Role	Primary Function	Dashboard Access
Site Supervisor	Report incidents, monitor compliance	/site-supervisor
Worker	Check-ins, follow rehab plans	/worker
Employer	Oversee cases, view analytics	/employer
Case Manager	Manage case lifecycle	/case-manager
Clinician	Assessment, rehab planning	/clinician
GP/Insurer	Review cases, access reports	/gp-insurer
ðŸ“Š Data Flow Summary
1.	Incident â†’ Case â†’ Rehab Plan â†’ Check-ins â†’ Return to Work
2.	All incidents create cases (not just severe ones)
3.	Workers get notified immediately when incidents are reported
4.	Daily check-ins track progress and compliance
5.	Analytics provide real-time insights for employers
ðŸ”§ What I Fixed
The issue was that only severe incidents (medical_treatment, lost_time, fatality) were creating cases. Now ALL incidents create cases, ensuring:
â€¢	âœ… Workers can check in for any incident
â€¢	âœ… Proper tracking and follow-up
â€¢	âœ… Compliance monitoring for all incidents
â€¢	âœ… Complete data for analytics
This ensures your system follows proper occupational health and safety protocols where every incident requires proper documentation and follow-up! ðŸš€
