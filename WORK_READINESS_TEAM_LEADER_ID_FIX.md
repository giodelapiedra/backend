# Work Readiness Team Leader ID & Team Fix

## 🎯 Problem Identified

When workers submit their work readiness assessments, the `team_leader_id` and `team` columns in the `work_readiness` table were NULL. This caused issues with:
1. ❌ Team leader reports not showing data properly
2. ❌ Work Readiness Activity Chart showing no data
3. ❌ Difficulty tracking which team leader is responsible for each assessment

## ✅ Root Cause

The backend service (`goalTracking.service.js`) was NOT saving `team_leader_id` and `team` fields when creating work readiness assessments.

**Before (Missing Fields):**
```javascript
const transformedAssessmentData = {
  worker_id: workerId,
  // ❌ team_leader_id: MISSING
  // ❌ team: MISSING
  readiness_level: actualReadinessLevel,
  fatigue_level: actualFatigueLevel,
  mood: assessmentData.mood,
  pain_discomfort: assessmentData.pain_discomfort,
  notes: assessmentData.notes || null,
  cycle_start: cycleStart,
  cycle_day: cycleDay,
  streak_days: streakDays,
  cycle_completed: cycleCompleted,
  submitted_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Team Leader Lookup in Backend Service**

File: `backend/services/goalTracking.service.js`

**New Logic Added (Before Line 460):**
```javascript
// Get worker's team and team leader info
let teamLeaderId = null;
let workerTeam = worker.team || null;

if (worker.team) {
  try {
    const { supabase } = require('../config/supabase');
    
    // Look for team leader who manages this team (in managed_teams array)
    const { data: teamLeader, error: teamLeaderError } = await supabase
      .from('users')
      .select('id, first_name, last_name, managed_teams')
      .eq('role', 'team_leader')
      .eq('is_active', true)
      .contains('managed_teams', [worker.team])
      .single();
    
    if (!teamLeaderError && teamLeader) {
      teamLeaderId = teamLeader.id;
      logger.logBusiness('Found Team Leader for Worker', { 
        workerId, 
        workerTeam: worker.team,
        teamLeaderId: teamLeader.id, 
        teamLeaderName: `${teamLeader.first_name} ${teamLeader.last_name}`,
        managedTeams: teamLeader.managed_teams
      });
    } else {
      // Fallback: try to find team leader by team field
      const { data: fallbackLeader, error: fallbackError } = await supabase
        .from('users')
        .select('id, first_name, last_name, team')
        .eq('role', 'team_leader')
        .eq('team', worker.team)
        .eq('is_active', true)
        .single();
      
      if (!fallbackError && fallbackLeader) {
        teamLeaderId = fallbackLeader.id;
        logger.logBusiness('Found Team Leader (Fallback) for Worker', { 
          workerId, 
          workerTeam: worker.team,
          teamLeaderId: fallbackLeader.id, 
          teamLeaderName: `${fallbackLeader.first_name} ${fallbackLeader.last_name}`
        });
      } else {
        logger.warn('Team Leader Not Found for Worker', { 
          workerId, 
          workerTeam: worker.team,
          teamLeaderError: teamLeaderError?.message,
          fallbackError: fallbackError?.message
        });
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error finding team leader', { error: error.message, workerId, workerTeam: worker.team });
  }
} else {
  logger.warn('Worker has no team assigned', { workerId });
}
```

### 2. **Updated transformedAssessmentData to Include Team Fields**

**After (With Team Fields):**
```javascript
const transformedAssessmentData = {
  worker_id: workerId,
  team_leader_id: teamLeaderId,        // ✅ NOW INCLUDED!
  team: workerTeam,                    // ✅ NOW INCLUDED!
  readiness_level: actualReadinessLevel,
  fatigue_level: actualFatigueLevel,
  mood: assessmentData.mood,
  pain_discomfort: assessmentData.pain_discomfort,
  notes: assessmentData.notes || null,
  cycle_start: cycleStart,
  cycle_day: cycleDay,
  streak_days: streakDays,
  cycle_completed: cycleCompleted,
  submitted_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

### 3. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**

**New Assessment Creation Log:**
```javascript
logger.logBusiness('Creating New Assessment with Cycle Data', {
  workerId,
  teamLeaderId,
  team: workerTeam,
  readinessLevel: actualReadinessLevel
});

savedAssessment = await workReadinessRepo.createAssessment(transformedAssessmentData);

logger.logBusiness('New Assessment Saved with Cycle Data', { 
  assessmentId: savedAssessment.id,
  workerId: savedAssessment.worker_id,
  teamLeaderId: savedAssessment.team_leader_id,
  team: savedAssessment.team,
  readinessLevel: savedAssessment.readiness_level
});
```

## 📊 Data Flow (Corrected)

```
Worker Submits Assessment
       ↓
Backend Receives: { workerId, assessmentData }
       ↓
Get Worker Info (including worker.team)
       ↓
Lookup Team Leader by:
  1. managed_teams CONTAINS worker.team (Primary)
  2. team = worker.team (Fallback)
       ↓
Create transformedAssessmentData with:
  - worker_id
  - team_leader_id  ← ✅ NOW POPULATED
  - team           ← ✅ NOW POPULATED
  - readiness_level
  - fatigue_level
  - mood
  - pain_discomfort
  - notes
  - cycle data
       ↓
Save to work_readiness table
       ↓
✅ team_leader_id and team are now in database!
```

## 🔍 Team Leader Lookup Strategy

### Primary Method (Preferred)
```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, managed_teams
FROM users
WHERE role = 'team_leader'
  AND is_active = true
  AND managed_teams @> ARRAY['worker_team']::text[]
LIMIT 1;
```

### Fallback Method
```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, team
FROM users
WHERE role = 'team_leader'
  AND is_active = true
  AND team = 'worker_team'
LIMIT 1;
```

## ✅ Benefits of This Fix

1. **Complete Data Integrity**
   - Every work readiness submission now has `team_leader_id` and `team` populated
   - No more NULL values causing report issues

2. **Better Team Leader Reports**
   - Team leaders can now see all submissions from their workers
   - Work Readiness Activity Chart now displays data correctly

3. **Enhanced Tracking**
   - Clear ownership of each assessment
   - Easy to query by team leader
   - Better audit trail

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Every team leader lookup is logged
   - Warnings for workers without teams
   - Errors logged if team leader not found

5. **Robust Fallback Logic**
   - Primary lookup via `managed_teams` array
   - Fallback lookup via `team` field
   - Graceful handling when team leader not found

## 📝 Database Impact

### Before
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  worker_id,
  team_leader_id,  -- NULL ❌
  team,            -- NULL ❌
  readiness_level,
  submitted_at
FROM work_readiness
WHERE submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### After
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  worker_id,
  team_leader_id,  -- UUID ✅
  team,            -- 'Team A' ✅
  readiness_level,
  submitted_at
FROM work_readiness
WHERE submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Test New Submissions

**As Worker:**
1. Login as worker
2. Submit work readiness assessment
3. Check backend logs for:
   ```
   ✅ Found Team Leader for Worker
   ✅ New Assessment Saved with Cycle Data
   ```

### 2. Verify Database

```sql
-- Check latest work readiness submissions
SELECT 
  wr.id,
  wr.worker_id,
  w.first_name || ' ' || w.last_name AS worker_name,
  w.team AS worker_team,
  wr.team_leader_id,
  tl.first_name || ' ' || tl.last_name AS team_leader_name,
  wr.team,
  wr.readiness_level,
  wr.submitted_at
FROM work_readiness wr
LEFT JOIN users w ON w.id = wr.worker_id
LEFT JOIN users tl ON tl.id = wr.team_leader_id
WHERE wr.submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY wr.submitted_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ `team_leader_id` should NOT be NULL
- ✅ `team` should match worker's team
- ✅ `team_leader_name` should display correctly

### 3. Test Team Leader Dashboard

**As Team Leader:**
1. Login as team leader
2. Navigate to Work Readiness KPI page
3. Check that chart now displays data
4. Verify worker performance metrics are showing

### 4. Check Backend Logs

**Look for these log messages:**
```
✅ Found Team Leader for Worker
   workerId: 'xxx'
   workerTeam: 'Team A'
   teamLeaderId: 'yyy'
   teamLeaderName: 'John Doe'
   managedTeams: ['Team A', 'Team B']

✅ New Assessment Saved with Cycle Data
   assessmentId: 'zzz'
   workerId: 'xxx'
   teamLeaderId: 'yyy'
   team: 'Team A'
   readinessLevel: 'fit'
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases Handled

1. **Worker with No Team**
   - `team` will be NULL
   - `team_leader_id` will be NULL
   - Warning logged: "Worker has no team assigned"

2. **Team Leader Not Found**
   - Both primary and fallback lookups attempted
   - `team_leader_id` will be NULL
   - Warning logged: "Team Leader Not Found for Worker"

3. **Multiple Team Leaders for Same Team**
   - Uses `.single()` to get first match
   - Logs the selected team leader

4. **Inactive Team Leaders**
   - Filters by `is_active = true`
   - Only active team leaders considered

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Files Modified
- ✅ `backend/services/goalTracking.service.js`
- ✅ `frontend/src/store/api/teamLeaderApi.ts` (data mapping fix from previous)

### No Database Migration Required
- Columns `team_leader_id` and `team` already exist in `work_readiness` table
- This is a backend logic fix only
- All new submissions will have these fields populated

### Backend Restart Required
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Verification SQL Queries

### Query 1: Check Team Leader Population Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_submissions,
  COUNT(team_leader_id) as with_team_leader,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(team_leader_id) as without_team_leader,
  ROUND(COUNT(team_leader_id)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as population_rate_percent
FROM work_readiness
WHERE submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

**Expected After Fix:**
- `population_rate_percent` should be close to 100%

### Query 2: Check Team Distribution
```sql
SELECT 
  team,
  COUNT(*) as submission_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT team_leader_id) as unique_team_leaders,
  COUNT(DISTINCT worker_id) as unique_workers
FROM work_readiness
WHERE submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND team IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY submission_count DESC;
```

### Query 3: Find Submissions Still Without Team Leader
```sql
SELECT 
  wr.id,
  wr.worker_id,
  u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as worker_name,
  u.team as worker_team,
  wr.submitted_at
FROM work_readiness wr
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = wr.worker_id
WHERE wr.submitted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND wr.team_leader_id IS NULL
ORDER BY wr.submitted_at DESC;
```

**Action if rows found:**
- Check if workers have team assigned
- Check if team leaders exist for those teams
- Check if team leaders are active

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ All new work readiness submissions have `team_leader_id` populated
- ✅ All new work readiness submissions have `team` populated
- ✅ Backend logs show successful team leader lookup
- ✅ Work Readiness Activity Chart displays data correctly
- ✅ Team Leader KPI dashboard shows accurate metrics
- ✅ No NULL values in recent submissions (unless worker has no team)
