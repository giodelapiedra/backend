# Rehabilitation Plan Cancellation - Data Deletion Implementation

## Summary
Updated the rehabilitation plan cancellation process to permanently delete cancelled plans from the database instead of just marking them as 'cancelled'. This ensures that when a clinician cancels a plan, all associated data is completely removed from the `rehabilitation_plans` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### ClinicianDashboardRedux.tsx
- **Updated `handleConfirmCancelPlan` function** (lines 937-975):
  - Changed from updating status to 'cancelled' to completely deleting the record
  - Updated success message to reflect deletion
  - Updated console log message

- **Updated dialog message** (line 1884):
  - Changed warning text to indicate permanent deletion instead of just cancellation

### 2. Backend Changes

#### rehabilitationPlans.js
- **Updated DELETE route** (lines 799-827):
  - Changed access from 'Admin only' to 'Clinician, Case Manager, Admin'
  - Added authorization check to ensure clinicians can only delete their own plans
  - Case managers and admins can delete any plan

### 3. Database Changes

#### New SQL Script: add-clinician-delete-policy-rehabilitation-plans.sql
- **Added Row Level Security (RLS) policy**:
  - Allows clinicians to delete their own rehabilitation plans
  - Policy: `"Clinicians can delete their plans"`
  - Condition: `clinician_id = auth.uid()`

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### ACTIVE_REHABILITATION_PLAN_RESTRICTION.md
- **Updated status description** (line 24):
  - Added note that cancelled plans are now permanently deleted from the database

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Impact
- The `rehabilitation_plans` table structure remains unchanged
- Foreign key constraints are properly handled (CASCADE deletion)
- Unique constraints for active plans remain intact

### Security Considerations
- RLS policy ensures clinicians can only delete their own plans
- Backend route includes proper authorization checks
- No data leakage between different clinicians' plans

### Data Integrity
- Deletion removes all plan data including:
  - Exercises and daily completions
  - Progress statistics
  - Alerts and settings
  - All historical data associated with the plan

## Migration Instructions

1. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: add-clinician-delete-policy-rehabilitation-plans.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy frontend and backend changes**:
   - Frontend: Updated ClinicianDashboardRedux.tsx
   - Backend: Updated rehabilitationPlans.js route

3. **Verify the changes**:
   - Test cancellation flow in clinician dashboard
   - Confirm plans are deleted from database
   - Verify RLS policy works correctly

## Benefits

1. **Data Cleanup**: Cancelled plans no longer clutter the database
2. **Privacy**: Sensitive plan data is completely removed when cancelled
3. **Performance**: Reduced database size and improved query performance
4. **User Experience**: Clear indication that cancellation is permanent
5. **Compliance**: Better data handling for privacy requirements

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing completed plans remain in the database
- Only new cancellations will result in deletion
- No impact on existing active or paused plans
- Historical data for completed plans is preserved

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clinician cannot cancel another clinician's plan
- [ ] Case manager can cancel any plan
- [ ] Admin can cancel any plan
- [ ] Cancelled plans are completely removed from database
- [ ] UI shows appropriate warning about permanent deletion
- [ ] Success message reflects deletion
- [ ] Data refresh works correctly after deletion
