# ✅ Appointments Feature - Supabase Migration COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully restored and migrated the Appointments feature from MongoDB to Supabase with full functionality including notifications for workers.

## What Was Done

### 1. Backend Implementation ✅

#### Created New Controller (`backend/controllers/appointmentsController.js`)
- **Supabase Integration**: Direct Supabase client initialization
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `getAppointments()` - Fetch appointments with pagination
  - `getAppointmentById()` - Get single appointment with related data
  - `createAppointment()` - Create new appointment
  - `updateAppointment()` - Update appointment details
  - `updateAppointmentStatus()` - Update appointment status
  - `deleteAppointment()` - Delete appointment
  - `getCalendarAppointments()` - Get appointments for calendar view

#### Updated Routes (`backend/routes/appointments.js`)
- Changed from MongoDB `isMongoId()` to Supabase `isUUID()` validators
- Used `authenticateToken` and `requireRole` from authSupabase middleware
- All routes properly validated and protected

#### Matched Actual Supabase Schema
Fixed to match YOUR actual schema:
```sql
create table public.appointments (
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
  case_id uuid null,
  clinician_id uuid null,
  appointment_type character varying(50) null,
  scheduled_date timestamp with time zone null,
  duration_minutes integer null,  -- NOTE: duration_minutes not duration!
  status character varying(20) null default 'scheduled',
  notes text null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone null default now()
)
```

### 2. Frontend Implementation ✅

#### Fixed Authentication (`frontend/src/pages/Appointments.tsx`)
- Changed from `AuthContext` to `AuthContext.supabase`
- All API calls now use `backendApi` instead of old `api`

#### Created Backend API Client (`frontend/src/utils/backendApi.ts`)
- Axios instance with Supabase JWT token integration
- Automatic token attachment from Supabase auth
- Error handling and logging
- Exported `kpiAPI` methods for Goal Tracking features

#### Fixed Cases Fetching (`frontend/src/utils/supabaseApi.ts`)
- Updated `getCases()` to include worker and clinician data
- Proper foreign key relationships using Supabase syntax

### 3. Notification System ✅

#### Worker Notifications
When an appointment is created, the worker receives:
- **Type**: `appointment_scheduled`
- **Priority**: `high`
- **Message**: Details about the appointment (date, time, type)
- **Action**: Link to `/appointments` page
- **Metadata**: appointment_id, case_number, clinician_name, etc.

#### Clinician Notifications  
The clinician also receives:
- **Type**: `appointment_scheduled`
- **Priority**: `medium`
- **Message**: Confirmation of scheduled appointment with worker details
- **Metadata**: appointment_id, worker_name, case_number, etc.

### 4. Key Features

✅ **Create Appointments**
- Select a case with assigned worker and clinician
- Choose appointment type (assessment, treatment, follow_up, consultation, telehealth)
- Set date, time, and duration
- Add notes
- Automatic notifications sent to worker and clinician

✅ **View Appointments**
- Paginated list view
- Filtered by user role (clinician sees their appointments, workers see theirs)
- Color-coded status chips
- Case number and worker information displayed

✅ **Update Appointments**
- Edit appointment details
- Change status
- Add notes

✅ **Delete Appointments**
- Admin, case managers, and clinicians can delete

✅ **Calendar View** (route available)
- `/appointments/calendar` endpoint ready
- Can be integrated with calendar component

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in `backend/.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/appointments
- Query params: `page`, `limit`, `status`, `appointmentType`, `date`, etc.
- Returns: Paginated appointments list

### POST /api/appointments
- Body: `case`, `appointmentType`, `scheduledDate`, `duration`, `notes`
- Creates appointment and sends notifications
- Returns: Created appointment

### GET /api/appointments/:id
- Returns: Single appointment with related data

### PUT /api/appointments/:id
- Updates appointment details

### PUT /api/appointments/:id/status
- Updates appointment status only

### DELETE /api/appointments/:id
- Deletes appointment

### GET /api/appointments/calendar
- Query params: `start`, `end` (ISO dates)
- Returns: Appointments formatted for calendar

## Frontend Routes

- `/appointments` - Main appointments page
- Role-based access:
  - **Workers**: See their own appointments
  - **Clinicians**: See appointments they're assigned to
  - **Case Managers**: See all appointments
  - **Admins**: See all appointments

## Testing Checklist

✅ Backend server starts without errors
✅ Frontend compiles without errors
✅ Can view `/appointments` page
✅ Can fetch cases for appointment creation
✅ Can create new appointment
✅ Worker receives notification
✅ Clinician receives notification
✅ Appointments display correctly
✅ Pagination works
✅ Can update appointment status
✅ Can delete appointment

## Database Requirements

Your Supabase `appointments` table must exist with the schema shown above. If it doesn't exist, run:

```sql
create table public.appointments (
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
  case_id uuid null,
  clinician_id uuid null,
  appointment_type character varying(50) null,
  scheduled_date timestamp with time zone null,
  duration_minutes integer null,
  status character varying(20) null default 'scheduled'::character varying,
  notes text null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
  constraint appointments_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint appointments_case_id_fkey foreign key (case_id) references cases (id),
  constraint appointments_clinician_id_fkey foreign key (clinician_id) references users (id)
) tablespace pg_default;

-- Add index for performance
create index idx_appointments_case_id on public.appointments(case_id);
create index idx_appointments_clinician_id on public.appointments(clinician_id);
create index idx_appointments_scheduled_date on public.appointments(scheduled_date);
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add worker_id column** to appointments table for direct worker reference
2. **Add location column** for appointment location tracking
3. **Add virtual meeting support** (Zoom integration)
4. **Calendar view component** in frontend
5. **Email notifications** for appointments
6. **SMS reminders** 24 hours before appointment
7. **Appointment history** tracking
8. **Recurring appointments** support

## Files Modified

### Backend
- ✅ `backend/controllers/appointmentsController.js` (NEW)
- ✅ `backend/routes/appointments.js` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `backend/server.js` (already has route mounted)

### Frontend
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/Appointments.tsx` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `frontend/src/utils/backendApi.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `frontend/src/utils/supabaseApi.ts` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `frontend/src/App.tsx` (already has route)

## Success Criteria Met ✅

1. ✅ Appointments page loads without errors
2. ✅ Can create appointments
3. ✅ Workers get notified
4. ✅ Clinicians get notified
5. ✅ Uses Supabase (not MongoDB)
6. ✅ All CRUD operations work
7. ✅ Role-based access control works
8. ✅ Data is properly validated
