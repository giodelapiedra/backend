-- Simple Fix: Add team_leader_id column to users table
-- Based on the actual users table schema provided

-- ========================================
-- STEP 1: ADD MISSING COLUMN
-- ========================================

-- Add team_leader_id column to users table
ALTER TABLE public.users 
ADD COLUMN team_leader_id UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_team_leader_id ON public.users(team_leader_id);

-- Add comment to document the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.users.team_leader_id IS 'ID of the team leader who manages this user. Used for workers to link to their team leader.';

-- ========================================
-- STEP 2: VERIFY COLUMN ADDITION
-- ========================================

-- Check if column was added successfully
SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' 
AND column_name = 'team_leader_id';

-- ========================================
-- STEP 3: POPULATE TEAM LEADER ASSIGNMENTS
-- ========================================

-- Assign team leaders to workers based on team matching
UPDATE public.users 
SET team_leader_id = (
    SELECT tl.id 
    FROM public.users tl 
    WHERE tl.role = 'team_leader'

        users.team = tl.team 
        OR users.team = ANY(tl.managed_teams)
    )
    LIMIT 1
)
WHERE role = 'worker' 
AND team_leader_id IS NULL
AND team IS NOT NULL;

-- ========================================
-- STEP 4: VERIFY TEAM ASSIGNMENTS
-- ========================================

-- Check team assignment coverage
SELECT 
    'TEAM ASSIGNMENT COVERAGE' as section,
    COUNT(*) as total_workers,
    COUNT(team_leader_id) as workers_with_team_leaders,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(team_leader_id) as workers_without_team_leaders,
    ROUND(COUNT(team_leader_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as coverage_percentage
FROM public.users 
WHERE role = 'worker' 
AND is_active = true;

-- Show team leader assignments
SELECT 
    'TEAM LEADER ASSIGNMENTS' as section,
    tl.first_name || ' ' || tl.last_name as team_leader_name,
    tl.email as team_leader_email,
    tl.team as team_leader_team,
    tl.managed_teams,
    COUNT(w.id) as workers_managed,
    ARRAY_AGG(w.first_name || ' ' || w.last_name) as worker_names
FROM public.users tl
LEFT JOIN public.users w ON w.team_leader_id = tl.id AND w.role = 'worker' AND w.is_active = true
WHERE tl.role = 'team_leader' 
AND tl.is_active = true
GROUP BY tl.id, tl.first_name, tl.last_name, tl.email, tl.team, tl.managed_teams
