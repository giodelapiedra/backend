# Work Readiness Assignment Manager - Team Leader Dashboard Integration

## ✅ Tapos na ang Integration!

Naka-integrate na ang Work Readiness Assignment Manager sa Team Leader Dashboard. Automatic na filtered based sa team ng team leader.

## 📍 Location

**Dashboard Path:** `/team-leader`

**Component Location:** `frontend/src/pages/teamLeader/TeamLeaderDashboard.tsx`

**Assignment Manager:** `frontend/src/components/WorkReadinessAssignmentManager.tsx`

## 🎯 Features

### 1. **Team-Specific Filtering**
```typescript
<WorkReadinessAssignmentManager 
  teamLeaderId={user.id}  // Current team leader ID
  team={user.team}        // Team leader's team
/>
```

- ✅ Makikita lang ng team leader ang **kanyang team members**
- ✅ Hindi makikita ang members ng ibang teams
- ✅ Automatic filtering based sa `team` field

### 2. **Backend Validation**
```javascript
// backend/controllers/workReadinessAssignmentController.js

// Verify workers belong to team leader's team
const invalidWorkers = workers.filter(
  w => w.team !== team || (w.team_leader_id && w.team_leader_id !== teamLeaderId)
);

if (invalidWorkers.length > 0) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    error: 'Some workers do not belong to your team'
  });
}
```

### 3. **Assignment Creation Flow**

1. **Team Leader opens dashboard** → `/team-leader`
2. **Clicks "Create Assignment"** button
3. **Sees only their team members** in the selection list
4. **Selects workers** to assign
5. **Sets date, time, and notes**
6. **Submits** → Backend validates team ownership
7. **Workers receive assignments** automatically

### 4. **Data Security**

#### Frontend Level:
```typescript
// Only fetch team members from team leader's team
const { teamMembers: members } = await SupabaseAPI.getTeamMembers(
  teamLeaderId,  // Team leader ID
  team           // Team name filter
);
```

#### Backend Level:
```javascript
// Verify team ownership before creating assignments
const { data: workers } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('users')
  .select('id, team, team_leader_id')
  .in('id', workerIds)
  .eq('role', 'worker');

// Check if all workers belong to the team leader
const invalidWorkers = workers.filter(
  w => w.team !== team || w.team_leader_id !== teamLeaderId
);
```

#### Database Level (RLS):
```sql
-- Team leaders can only view their own assignments
CREATE POLICY "Team leaders can view own assignments" 
ON work_readiness_assignments
FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = team_leader_id OR
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM users 
        WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
        AND users.role IN ('admin', 'site_supervisor')
    )
);
```

## 🔐 Multi-Level Security

### Level 1: Frontend Filtering
- UI only shows team members from team leader's team
- Component receives `team` prop to filter data

### Level 2: API Filtering
- `getTeamMembers(teamLeaderId, team)` filters by team
- Only returns workers from specified team

### Level 3: Backend Validation
- Controller verifies team ownership
- Rejects assignments to workers from other teams
- Returns 403 Forbidden if validation fails

### Level 4: Database RLS
- Row Level Security policies enforce access control
- Team leaders can only see their assignments
- Workers can only see assignments assigned to them

## 📊 Example Scenario

### Team Leader A (Team Alpha):
- **Team Members:** Worker 1, Worker 2, Worker 3
- **Can See:** Only Worker 1, 2, 3 in assignment list
- **Can Assign:** Only Worker 1, 2, 3
- **Cannot See:** Workers from Team Beta, Team Gamma

### Team Leader B (Team Beta):
- **Team Members:** Worker 4, Worker 5
- **Can See:** Only Worker 4, 5 in assignment list
- **Can Assign:** Only Worker 4, 5
- **Cannot See:** Workers from Team Alpha, Team Gamma

### If Team Leader A tries to assign Worker 4:
```json
{
  "error": "Some workers do not belong to your team",
  "invalidWorkers": ["worker-4-id"]
}
```
