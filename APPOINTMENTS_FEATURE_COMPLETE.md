# Appointments Feature - Complete Implementation

## Summary
Successfully migrated and implemented the appointments feature from MongoDB to Supabase, including full backend API, frontend integration, and calendar view for clinicians.

---

## Database Schema

```sql
create table public.appointments (
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
  case_id uuid null,
  clinician_id uuid null,
  appointment_type character varying(50) null,
  scheduled_date timestamp with time zone null,
  duration_minutes integer null,
  status character varying(20) null default 'scheduled'::character varying,
  notes text null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
  constraint appointments_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint appointments_case_id_fkey foreign KEY (case_id) references cases (id),
  constraint appointments_clinician_id_fkey foreign KEY (clinician_id) references users (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

## Backend Implementation

### Files Created/Updated

#### 1. **backend/controllers/appointmentsController.js**
- **Purpose**: Handles all appointment-related business logic using Supabase
- **Key Functions**:
  - `getAppointments()` - Fetch appointments with filtering, pagination, role-based access
  - `getAppointmentById()` - Get single appointment with full details
  - `createAppointment()` - Create new appointment and notify worker
  - `updateAppointment()` - Update appointment details
  - `updateAppointmentStatus()` - Update appointment status
  - `deleteAppointment()` - Delete appointment (soft delete recommended)
  - `getCalendarAppointments()` - Fetch appointments for calendar view with date range filtering

- **Key Features**:
  - âœ… Supabase integration using `supabaseAdmin` client
  - âœ… Role-based filtering (clinicians see only their appointments)
  - âœ… Foreign key relationships (case â†’ worker, clinician)
  - âœ… Notification creation for worker when appointment is created
  - âœ… Proper data transformation to match frontend expectations
  - âœ… Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### 2. **backend/routes/appointments.js**
- **Purpose**: Define API endpoints and validation rules
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/appointments` - List appointments with filtering
  - `GET /api/appointments/calendar` - Calendar view appointments
  - `GET /api/appointments/:id` - Single appointment details
  - `POST /api/appointments` - Create appointment
  - `PUT /api/appointments/:id` - Update appointment
  - `PUT /api/appointments/:id/status` - Update status
  - `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment

- **Validation**:
  - UUID validation for all IDs
  - ISO8601 date validation
  - Enum validation for appointment types and statuses
  - Role-based authorization using `requireRole` middleware

  - Added `backendApi` integration
  - ISO date format for API queries
  - Proper event transformation for calendar display

#### 3. **frontend/src/utils/backendApi.ts**

- **Features**:
  - âœ… Automatic Supabase token injection
  - âœ… Error handling and logging
  - âœ… KPI API methods (preserved existing functionality)
  - âœ… Test connection method

- **Key Additions**:
  ```typescript
  export interface AssignmentKPIResponse {
    success: boolean;
    kpi: any;
    metrics: any;
    cycle: any;
    message?: string;
    period?: any;
    recentAssignments?: any[];
  }

  export const kpiAPI = {
    getWorkerAssignmentKPI(workerId: string): Promise<AssignmentKPIResponse>
    getWorkerWeeklyProgress(workerId: string)
    getTeamAssignmentSummary(teamLeaderId: string)
    getTeamWeeklySummary(teamLeaderId: string)
    submitAssessment(data: any)
  }

  export const testBackendConnection()
  ```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Appointment Creation**
- Select case (with worker information)
- Select clinician
- Set appointment type (assessment, treatment, follow-up, consultation, telehealth)
- Set scheduled date and time
- Set duration in minutes
- Add notes
- **Auto-notification**: Worker is notified when appointment is created

### 2. **Calendar View**
- Month-based navigation
- Visual calendar grid
- Appointment blocks on scheduled dates
- Color coding by status:
  - ðŸŸ¦ **Scheduled** - Blue
  - ðŸŸ© **Confirmed** - Green
  - ðŸŸ¨ **In Progress** - Yellow
  - âœ… **Completed** - Gray
  - ðŸŸ¥ **Cancelled** - Red
  - âš« **No Show** - Dark

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Clinicians**: See only appointments assigned to them
- **Admin/Case Managers**: See all appointments
- **Workers**: Can view their own appointments

### 4. **Data Relationships**
```
appointments
  â”œâ”€â”€ case_id â†’ cases
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ worker_id â†’ users (worker)
  â””â”€â”€ clinician_id â†’ users (clinician)
```

## API Usage Examples

### Create Appointment
```javascript
const appointment = await backendApi.post('/appointments', {
  case: 'case-uuid',
  clinician: 'clinician-uuid',
  appointmentType: 'assessment',
  scheduledDate: '2025-10-28T08:00:00Z',
  duration: 60,
  notes: 'Initial assessment'
});
```

### Fetch Calendar Appointments
```javascript
const events = await backendApi.get('/appointments/calendar', {
  params: {
    start: '2025-10-01T00:00:00Z',
    end: '2025-10-31T23:59:59Z'
  }
});
```

### Update Appointment Status
```javascript
await backendApi.put(`/appointments/${id}/status`, {
  status: 'completed',
  notes: 'Session completed successfully'
});
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create appointment from Appointments page
- [x] View appointments list
- [x] Worker name displays correctly
- [x] Clinician name displays correctly
- [x] Calendar shows appointments on correct dates
- [x] Clinicians see only their appointments
- [x] Worker receives notification on appointment creation
- [x] Update appointment details
- [x] Update appointment status
- [x] Delete appointment
- [x] Date filtering works correctly
- [x] Role-based access control enforced

---

## Important Notes

### Database Fields
- `duration_minutes` (not `duration`) - Store duration in minutes
- `scheduled_date` - Use timezone-aware timestamps
- Worker data accessed through `case_id` â†’ `worker_id` relationship

### Frontend Considerations
- Always use optional chaining (`?.`) for worker/clinician data
- Handle null cases gracefully
- Use ISO date format for API calls
- Transform backend calendar events to frontend format

### Backend Considerations
- Use `supabaseAdmin` for admin operations (bypasses RLS)
- Always include role-based filtering for non-admin users
- Log all operations for debugging
- Validate UUIDs properly
- Include foreign key data in select queries using explicit column names

---

## Debugging

### Console Logs Added
- Backend: Logs all appointments in system, date filtering, query results
- Frontend: Logs API requests, responses, transformed data

### Common Issues Fixed
1. âœ… **Mock data in calendar** - Updated to fetch real data
2. âœ… **Null worker/clinician** - Added optional chaining
3. âœ… **Date format mismatch** - Switched to ISO format
4. âœ… **Schema mismatch** - Aligned with actual Supabase schema
5. âœ… **Foreign key names** - Used explicit column names instead of auto-generated names
6. âœ… **Duplicate frontend folders** - Removed unused `backend/frontend` folder

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Removed unused `backend/frontend` folder** - Reduces IDE indexing and confusion
2. **Added proper indexes** (recommended):
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_clinician ON appointments(clinician_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_case ON appointments(case_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_date ON appointments(scheduled_date);
   ```

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Recurring appointments
- [ ] Email/SMS reminders
- [ ] Video call integration for telehealth
- [ ] Appointment history and analytics
- [ ] Bulk appointment operations
- [ ] Export appointments to calendar (iCal)
- [ ] Appointment conflicts detection
- [ ] Waiting list management

---

## Conclusion

The appointments feature is now **fully functional** with:
- âœ… Complete backend API using Supabase
- âœ… Working frontend for creating/managing appointments
- âœ… Calendar view for clinicians
- âœ… Role-based access control
- âœ… Worker notifications
- âœ… Proper data relationships
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling
- âœ… Debugging capabilities

**Status**: Ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
