# üöÄ Complete Setup Guide - Work Readiness Assignments & Notifications

## ‚ùå **Current Issue:**
```
Error: Could not find a relationship between 'work_readiness_assignments' and 'users'
```

**Translation:** Table `work_readiness_assignments` doesn't exist yet sa Supabase!

---

## ‚úÖ **Complete Setup Steps**

### Step 1: Create Assignment Table in Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Login with your account
   - Select your project: `dtcgzgbxhefwhqpeotrl`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** sa left sidebar
   - Click **"New Query"**

3. **Copy and Run This SQL**
```sql
-- =============================================
-- WORK READINESS ASSIGNMENTS TABLE
-- =============================================

-- Drop existing table if any (for clean install)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.work_readiness_assignments CASCADE;

-- Create the assignments table
CREATE TABLE public.work_readiness_assignments (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    team_leader_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    worker_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    assigned_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    due_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours',
    notification_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    notification_sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    team TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'overdue', 'cancelled')),
    notes TEXT,
    reminder_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    work_readiness_id UUID REFERENCES public.work_readiness(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    CONSTRAINT fk_team_leader FOREIGN KEY (team_leader_id) REFERENCES public.users(id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_worker FOREIGN KEY (worker_id) REFERENCES public.users(id),
    CONSTRAINT unique_assignment_per_worker_per_day UNIQUE (worker_id, assigned_date)
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_work_readiness_assignments_team_leader ON public.work_readiness_assignments(team_leader_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_work_readiness_assignments_worker ON public.work_readiness_assignments(worker_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_work_readiness_assignments_date ON public.work_readiness_assignments(assigned_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_work_readiness_assignments_status ON public.work_readiness_assignments(status);

-- Enable RLS (Row Level Security)
ALTER TABLE public.work_readiness_assignments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policy: Allow all for service role (backend)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all for service role" ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR ALL USING (true);

-- RLS Policy: Team leaders can see their assignments
CREATE POLICY "Team leaders can view own assignments" ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = team_leader_id);

-- RLS Policy: Workers can see their assignments
CREATE POLICY "Workers can view own assignments" ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = worker_id);

-- RLS Policy: Team leaders can create assignments
CREATE POLICY "Team leaders can create assignments" ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = team_leader_id);

-- RLS Policy: Team leaders can update their assignments
CREATE POLICY "Team leaders can update own assignments" ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = team_leader_id);

-- RLS Policy: Workers can update their assignments (to mark complete)
CREATE POLICY "Workers can update own assignments" ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = worker_id);

-- Function to update updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_work_readiness_assignments_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

-- Trigger to auto-update updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER update_work_readiness_assignments_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON public.work_readiness_assignments
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_work_readiness_assignments_updated_at();

-- Success message
SELECT 'Work Readiness Assignments table created successfully!' as message,
       'Now you can create assignments and send notifications!' as next_step;
```

4. **Click "Run"** button (or press Ctrl + Enter)

5. **Verify Success**
   - Should see: ‚úÖ "Work Readiness Assignments table created successfully!"

---

### Step 2: Verify Notifications Table Exists

Run this in SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check if notifications table exists
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'notifications'
AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

Expected columns:
- ‚úÖ `id`
- ‚úÖ `recipient_id`
- ‚úÖ `sender_id`
- ‚úÖ `type`
- ‚úÖ `title`
- ‚úÖ `message`
- ‚úÖ `priority`
- ‚úÖ `is_read`
- ‚úÖ `metadata`
- ‚úÖ `created_at`

If missing, notifications table already exists from your migration!

---

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server

1. **Kill existing backend**
```powershell
# Press Ctrl + C in backend terminal
# OR
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

2. **Start backend fresh**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\GIO\project\backend
npm start
```

3. **Should see:**
```
KPI API Server running on port 5001
```

4. **NO MORE ERRORS about relationships!**

---

### Step 4: Test Assignment Creation

1. **Login as Team Leader**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use team leader credentials

2. **Go to Assignments Page**
   - Click "Assignments" in sidebar
   - Or go to: http://localhost:3000/team-leader/assignments

3. **Create Assignment**
   - Click "Create Assignment" button
   - Select date (today or tomorrow)
   - Select worker(s) from your team
   - Add notes (optional)
   - Click "Assign to X Workers"

4. **Check Console**
   - Backend terminal should show:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Team leader {id} created X assignments
   ```

---

### Step 5: Verify Worker Notification

#### Method 1: Check Database
```sql
-- Check if notification was created
SELECT 
    n.id,
    n.title,
    n.message,
    n.priority,
    n.created_at,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as worker_name
FROM notifications n
JOIN users u ON n.recipient_id = u.id
WHERE n.type = 'work_readiness_assignment'
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Should see notification with:
- Title: "New Work Readiness Assignment"
- Priority: "high"
- Message: "You have been assigned..."

#### Method 2: Login as Worker
1. **Logout** (if logged in as team leader)
2. **Login as Worker** (the one you assigned to)
3. **Check Notifications**
   - Look at notification icon (top right)
   - Should have badge with number
   - Or go to: http://localhost:3000/notifications

Expected notification:
```
üîî New Work Readiness Assignment
‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

You have been assigned to complete a work readiness 
assessment. Due within 24 hours (Oct 7, 2025, 3:45 PM).

Note: [Any special instructions]
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Issue 1: Still Getting Relationship Error
**Problem:** Table not created properly

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT * FROM work_readiness_assignments LIMIT 1;

-- If error, run the CREATE TABLE script again
```

### Issue 2: No Notifications Created
**Problem:** Backend error or notification insert failed

**Solution:**
1. Check backend console for errors
2. Verify notifications table exists
3. Check RLS policies:
```sql
-- Disable RLS temporarily for testing
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Issue 3: Worker Doesn't See Notification
**Problem:** RLS policy blocking

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check notification exists
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE recipient_id = 'worker-id-here'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- If exists, check RLS policy
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Issue 4: Duplicate Assignments
**Problem:** Fixed! (removed duplicate insert)

**Solution:** Already fixed in controller

---

## ‚úÖ **Expected Flow**

```
1. Team Leader creates assignment
   ‚Üì
2. Backend receives request
   ‚Üì
3. Backend validates worker belongs to team
   ‚Üì
4. Backend creates assignment record
   ‚Üì
5. Backend creates notification record
   ‚Üì
6. Backend marks notification as sent
   ‚Üì
7. Worker sees notification immediately!
   ‚Üì
8. Worker clicks notification
   ‚Üì
9. Worker completes work readiness
   ‚Üì
10. Assignment marked as complete
```

---

## üéØ **Quick Test Script**

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- 1. Get a team leader
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, team, role 
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'team_leader' 
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Get workers from same team
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, team, role 
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'worker' 
AND team = 'Team Alpha'  -- Replace with team leader's team
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. After creating assignment, check it was created
SELECT * FROM work_readiness_assignments 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- 4. Check notification was created
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'work_readiness_assignment'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
