# Assignment Filtering Debug Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified:**
Workers who already have assignments for 2025-10-07 are still appearing in the "Select Team Members" list in the "Create Work Readiness Assignment" dialog.

## 🔧 **Debugging Steps Taken:**

### **1. Fixed TypeScript Error**
- **Issue**: `assignment.status === 'in_progress'` was causing TypeScript error
- **Root Cause**: Assignment status type only includes: `'pending' | 'completed' | 'overdue' | 'cancelled'`
- **Fix**: Removed `|| assignment.status === 'in_progress'` from filtering logic
- **Result**: TypeScript compilation error resolved ✅

### **2. Added Debug Logging**
- **Purpose**: Identify why filtering is not working correctly
- **Debug Points**:
  - Selected date format and value
  - All assignments data
  - Assignments filtered by selected date
  - Assigned worker IDs after filtering
  - Unselected worker IDs after filtering
  - Team members list
  - Final available members list

### **3. Current Filtering Logic**
```javascript
const getAvailableTeamMembers = () => {
  // Filter out workers who already have pending assignments for the selected date
  const assignedWorkerIds = assignments
    .filter(assignment => 
      assignment.assigned_date === assignedDate && 
      assignment.status === 'pending'
    )
    .map(assignment => assignment.worker_id);

  // Filter out workers who have unselected cases that are not closed for the selected date
  const unselectedWorkerIds = unselectedWorkers
    .filter(unselected => 
      unselected.assignment_date === assignedDate && 
      unselected.case_status !== 'closed'
    )
    .map(unselected => unselected.worker_id);

  // Filter out workers who are already selected in the current dialog
  const currentlySelectedIds = selectedWorkers;

  const availableMembers = teamMembers.filter(member => 
    !assignedWorkerIds.includes(member.id) && 
    !unselectedWorkerIds.includes(member.id) &&
    !currentlySelectedIds.includes(member.id)
  );

  return availableMembers;
};
```

## 🔍 **Potential Root Causes:**

### **1. Date Format Mismatch**
- **Issue**: `assignedDate` format might not match `assignment.assigned_date` format
- **Possible Formats**:
  - `assignedDate`: "2025-10-07" (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `assignment.assigned_date`: "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z" (ISO string)
- **Solution**: Normalize date formats for comparison

### **2. Assignment Status Issue**
- **Issue**: Assignments might have different status than 'pending'
- **Possible Statuses**: 'completed', 'overdue', 'cancelled'
- **Solution**: Check if we should filter by other statuses too

### **3. Data Loading Timing**
- **Issue**: `assignments` data might not be loaded when `getAvailableTeamMembers()` is called
- **Solution**: Ensure data is loaded before filtering

### **4. ID Type Mismatch**
- **Issue**: `member.id` might be string while `assignment.worker_id` might be number (or vice versa)
- **Solution**: Ensure consistent ID types for comparison

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

### **1. Test with Debug Logging**
- Open the "Create Work Readiness Assignment" dialog
- Check browser console for debug output
- Identify which part of the filtering is failing

### **2. Check Date Format**
- Compare `assignedDate` format with `assignment.assigned_date` format
- Normalize dates if needed using `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`

### **3. Verify Assignment Data**
- Check if assignments are being loaded correctly
- Verify assignment status values
- Confirm worker IDs match between assignments and team members

### **4. Fix Filtering Logic**
- Based on debug output, fix the specific filtering issue
- Remove debug logging once issue is resolved

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**
Workers with existing 'pending' assignments for the selected date should NOT appear in the "Select Team Members" list.

## 🚀 **Current Status:**
- ✅ TypeScript errors fixed
- ✅ Debug logging added
- 🔄 Ready for testing with actual data
- ⏳ Waiting for user to test and provide debug output

The debug logging will help identify exactly why the filtering is not working as expected.
