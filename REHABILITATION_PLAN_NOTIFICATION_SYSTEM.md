# Rehabilitation Plan Notification System

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive notification system for rehabilitation plan activities that automatically notifies relevant parties when rehabilitation plans are assigned or completed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Clinician Assigns Rehabilitation Plan → Worker Gets Notified**
- **When**: Clinician creates a new rehabilitation plan
- **Who Gets Notified**: Worker assigned to the plan
- **Notification Type**: `rehab_plan_assigned`
- **Priority**: High
- **Message**: "Your clinician has assigned you a new rehabilitation plan: [Plan Name] for case [Case Number]. Please review and start your exercises."

### 2. **Worker Completes Rehabilitation Plan → Clinician Gets Notified**
- **When**: Worker completes all exercises in their rehabilitation plan
- **Who Gets Notified**: Clinician who created the plan
- **Notification Type**: `rehab_plan_completed`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Message**: "[Worker Name] has completed their rehabilitation plan '[Plan Name]' for case [Case Number]. Please review their progress and consider next steps."

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Backend Notification Service**

#### NotificationService.supabase.js
Added two new methods:

```javascript
// Notify worker when rehabilitation plan is assigned
static async createRehabPlanAssignmentNotification(workerId, clinicianId, planId, planName, caseNumber)

// Notify clinician when rehabilitation plan is completed
static async createRehabPlanCompletionNotification(clinicianId, workerId, planId, planName, caseNumber, workerName)
```

### 2. **Frontend Integration**

#### ClinicianDashboardRedux.tsx
- **Updated rehabilitation plan creation** to send notification to worker
- **Updated notification type** to `rehab_plan_assigned`
- **Enhanced success message** to confirm notification was sent

### 3. **Database Trigger**

#### notify-clinician-on-rehab-plan-completion.sql
- **Automatic notification** when rehabilitation plan status changes to 'completed'
- **Database-level trigger** ensures notifications are sent even if frontend fails
- **Comprehensive data gathering** from cases, users, and rehabilitation plans tables

## Notification Details

### Assignment Notification (Clinician → Worker)
```json
{
  "type": "rehab_plan_assigned",
  "title": "New Rehabilitation Plan Assigned",
  "message": "Your clinician has assigned you a new rehabilitation plan: \"Recovery Plan\" for case CASE-001. Please review and start your exercises.",
  "priority": "high",
  "metadata": {
    "plan_id": "uuid",
    "plan_name": "Recovery Plan",
    "case_number": "CASE-001",
    "task_type": "rehabilitation_plan"
  }
}
```

### Completion Notification (Worker → Clinician)
```json
{
  "type": "rehab_plan_completed",
  "title": "Rehabilitation Plan Completed",
  "message": "John Doe has completed their rehabilitation plan \"Recovery Plan\" for case CASE-001. Please review their progress and consider next steps.",
  "priority": "medium",
  "metadata": {
    "plan_id": "uuid",
    "plan_name": "Recovery Plan",
    "case_number": "CASE-001",
    "worker_name": "John Doe",
    "task_type": "rehabilitation_plan"
  }
}
```

## Database Schema

### Notifications Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    recipient_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    sender_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Workflow

### 1. **Rehabilitation Plan Assignment**
1. Clinician creates rehabilitation plan in dashboard
2. Frontend sends notification to worker
3. Worker receives notification in their dashboard
4. Worker can click notification to view their rehabilitation plan

### 2. **Rehabilitation Plan Completion**
1. Worker completes all exercises for the day
2. Database trigger detects status change to 'completed'
3. Trigger automatically creates notification for clinician
4. Clinician receives notification in their dashboard
5. Clinician can review worker's progress and take next steps

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Communication**: Immediate notifications keep all parties informed
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: Clinicians know when workers complete their plans
3. **Worker Engagement**: Workers are immediately notified of new assignments
4. **Data Integrity**: Database triggers ensure notifications are sent even if frontend fails
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all rehabilitation plan activities

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clinician creates rehabilitation plan → Worker receives notification
- [ ] Worker completes rehabilitation plan → Clinician receives notification
- [ ] Notifications appear in respective user dashboards
- [ ] Notification metadata contains correct plan and case information
- [ ] Database trigger fires when plan status changes to 'completed'
- [ ] Notification priority levels are correct (high for assignment, medium for completion)
- [ ] Error handling works if notification creation fails

## Migration Instructions

1. **Run the database trigger script**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: notify-clinician-on-rehab-plan-completion.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy backend changes**:
   - Updated NotificationService.supabase.js

3. **Deploy frontend changes**:
   - Updated ClinicianDashboardRedux.tsx

4. **Test the functionality**:
   - Create a rehabilitation plan and verify worker notification
   - Complete a rehabilitation plan and verify clinician notification
