# Authentication Logging Setup

## Problem
Team leaders couldn't see worker login status because authentication events weren't being logged to the `authentication_logs` table.

## Solution Implemented
✅ **Frontend Authentication Logging**: Modified `AuthContext.supabase.tsx` to automatically log login/logout events

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Authentication Context (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.supabase.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `logAuthenticationEvent()` function to log successful logins
- ✅ Added `logFailedAuthenticationEvent()` function to log failed login attempts  
- ✅ Modified `login()` function to log authentication events
- ✅ Modified `logout()` function to log logout events
- ✅ Added error handling so logging failures don't break authentication

### 2. Team Leader Analytics (`frontend/src/hooks/useWorkReadiness.ts`)
- ✅ Updated authentication logs query to use correct schema (`created_at`, `action`, `success`)
- ✅ Fixed `loggedInToday` logic to check for successful login events
- ✅ Fixed `lastLogin` display to show actual last login timestamp

### 3. Database Trigger Setup (`backend/scripts/create-auth-logging-trigger.sql`)
- ✅ Created database triggers for automatic authentication logging (manual setup required)

## Manual Database Setup Required

**Run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- The contents of backend/scripts/create-auth-logging-trigger.sql
-- This creates triggers to automatically log authentication events
```

## How It Works Now

### Login Process:
1. **Worker logs in** → `authClient.auth.signInWithPassword()`
2. **Authentication logged** → `logAuthenticationEvent()` called
3. **Database record** → Insert into `authentication_logs` table
4. **Team leader sees** → `loggedInToday: true` in dashboard

### Dashboard Display:
- ✅ **"Logged In"** status shows when worker has logged in today
- ✅ **"Not Logged In"** status shows when worker hasn't logged in
- ✅ **Real-time updates** when workers authenticate
- ✅ **Last login timestamp** shows actual login time

## Testing
1. Log in as a worker
2. Check team leader dashboard at `/team-leader`
3. Verify "Logged In" status appears ✅
4. Logout and see status change back to "Not Logged In" ❌

## Benefits
- 🎯 **Accurate tracking** of worker login status
- 📊 **Team leader monitoring** of worker activity
- 🔍 **Real-time updates** of login status
- 📈 **Better management** of team presence

All authentication events are now properly logged and visible to team leaders! 🎉
