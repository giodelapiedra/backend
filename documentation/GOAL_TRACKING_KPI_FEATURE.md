## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### 1. Controller: `goalKpiController.js`
```javascript
// Core Functions
- calculateKPI(completionPercentage) // KPI calculation logic
- getWeekDateRange(date) // Week boundary calculations
- getWorkerWeeklyProgress(req, res) // Worker data endpoint
- getTeamWeeklyKPI(req, res) // Team leader data endpoint
- calculateStreaks(assessments) // Streak calculations
```

**Key Features:**
- Modular design for maintainability
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimizations with indexed queries
- Automatic week boundary calculations (Monday-Sunday)

#### 2. Routes: `goalKpi.js`
```javascript
// API Endpoints
GET /api/goal-kpi/worker/weekly-progress    // Worker dashboard data
GET /api/goal-kpi/team-leader/weekly-summary // Team leader dashboard data
```

**Security:**
- Authentication middleware required
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

#### 3. Server Integration
- Added to main server.js routes
- Integrated with existing Supabase authentication
- Error handling and logging

### Frontend Components

#### 1. GoalTrackingCard.tsx
**Features:**
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Real-time data refresh capability
- Visual progress indicators
- Daily breakdown with completion status
- KPI badges with color coding
- Streak and achievement metrics

**Props:**
```typescript
interface GoalTrackingCardProps {
  userId: string;
  compact?: boolean; // For different layouts
}
```

#### 2. TeamKPIDashboard.tsx
**Features:**
- Team performance overview cards
- Individual member performance table
- Performance insights with automated alerts
- Responsive grid layout
- Refresh functionality
- Color-coded status indicators

**Props:**
```typescript
interface TeamKPIDashboardProps {
  teamLeaderId: string;
  compact?: boolean; // For different layouts
}
```

### Integration Points

#### Worker Dashboard Integration
```typescript
// Added to WorkerDashboard.tsx
import GoalTrackingCard from '../../components/GoalTrackingCard';

// Usage
<GoalTrackingCard userId={user?.id || ''} />
```

#### Team Leader Dashboard Integration
```typescript
// Added to TeamLeaderDashboard.tsx
import TeamKPIDashboard from '../../components/TeamKPIDashboard';

// Usage
<TeamKPIDashboard teamLeaderId={user?.id || ''} />
```

## Data Flow

### 1. Worker Weekly Progress Flow
```
User submits work_readiness ‚Üí 
Database stores submission_date ‚Üí 
GoalKPI Controller calculates weekly completion ‚Üí 
Worker dashboard displays progress & KPI
```

### 2. Team Leader Dashboard Flow
```
Team Leader accesses dashboard ‚Üí 
Controller fetches assigned workers ‚Üí 
Calculates individual KPIs for each worker ‚Üí 
Aggregates team performance metrics ‚Üí 
Displays comprehensive team overview
```

## Security & Privacy

### Authentication
- All API endpoints require valid authentication tokens
- Role-based access control (workers vs team leaders)

### Data Privacy
- Workers see only their own data
- Team leaders see only their assigned workers
- Secure API communication with Bearer tokens

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for service failures

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Queries
- Optimized Supabase queries with proper indexing
- Efficient date range filtering
- Minimal data transfer with selective fields

### Frontend Performance
- Memoized calculations
- Lazy loading capabilities
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- Material-UI components for consistency
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Interactive Elements
- Real-time refresh capability
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Tooltip explanations
- Progress visualization

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast visual indicators

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Historical Trends**: Multi-week performance graphs
